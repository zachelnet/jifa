      HIGH_THREAD_COUNT_SUGGESTION:
        "Such high thread counts can lead to memory exhaustion and thread starvation. " +
        "Look for thread leaks or consider using thread pools to reduce thread creation.",

      HIGH_CPU_RATIO_SUGGESTION:
        "A high CPU ratio means a thread is consuming large amounts of CPU over its lifetime. " +

      THREAD_THROWING_EXCEPTION_SUGGESTION:
        "A thread throwing an exception may indicate an issue in the application. " +
